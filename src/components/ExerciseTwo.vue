      <h3>My thoughts:</h3>

      <p>In the North Ireland, the current percentage of workforce engaged in remote working is 17%, a significant drop from 41% during pandemic in April 2020. In UK, the average is 31%.</p>
      <p>Those numbers is based on official data, an employee survey of 865 participants and consultations with 14 different business companies. The survey shows that two to three days as remote work per week is the majority.</p>
      <p>The researchers recommend a hybrid environment where workplace days bring teams together, while at-home days employers can focus on tasks completion.</p>
      <p>For me, the significant increase in remote jobs during pandemic is quite obvious, and the current percentage was expected as companies still with the cost of keep the offices running. I also agree with the researchers about hybrid environment.</p>
      <p>Anyway, employers and employee should work together to find the best solution for both sides.</p>
